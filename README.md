# Djikstra's Algorithm - John Beanblossom
Problem: Compute the shortest path from source A to destination B in the attached map-graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. In your main() function you should also show clearly how the graph is represented and accessed/processed with detailed annotations/comments.

Attached is the map used for this project.

Usage: There is no input for this program so the user will simply run the program, the output will be the shortest path from the source (point A) to the end of the map (point B). My result was 1.88, although this was not the shortest path that I heard, I heard of some people getting 1.75, so I believe that I have an error in my calculation somewhere, or potentially didn't add in the correct points.
